NDTPSO-SLAM
===========

NDTPSO-SLAM is a ROS package which provides an enhanced implementation of the scan matching algorithm proposed in [^art] and [^conf].
It uses NDT (Normal Distribution Transform) to model the environment and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) to perform the scan matching optimization and solve the pose problem.

This package has been tested with ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04, however; it should work with newer ROS1 versions.

This project is devided to two parts, the `libndtpso_slam` which is a C++ library that implements the proposed scan matching method, and in the other part, the ROS node `ndtpso_slam_node` which provides the ROS interface to this library.
